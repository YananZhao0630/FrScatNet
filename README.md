# FrScatNet
The code is for paper ``Deep scattering network with fractional wavelet transform'' published on IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing. (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3098936)
To reproducibility, one need to do some steps as following:
Step1: load addpath_scatnet.m
Step2: open file:paper/FrScatNet
In this paper, the results shown in Table III are calculated by
FrScatNet (Fractional scattering convolution network) ---- PCA_classification_FRSCN.m
SCN (Convolutional scattering convolution network) ---- PCA_classification_SCN.m
TFSCN (Time-frequency scattering convolution network) --- PCA_classification_TFSCN.m
